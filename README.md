## Instructions

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.

2. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/IMLS/public-libraries-survey/issues/new) to suggest a change to the FY 2024 Public Libraries Survey data elements. Note that you should open a separate issue for each proposed change. 

   In the **title**, indicate whether the request is an addition, revision, or deletion, and reference the existing data element number and name (for a revision or deletion).
   
   Then include the following information in the body of the request:

   * Your name and state/affiliation;
   * A description of the change, i.e.:
      * For **additions**, explain what should be collected and reported. A complete data element definition is not necessary.
      * For **revisions**, include the existing data element definition and explain which terms should be updated.
      * For **deletions**, include the existing data element definition.
   * Justification for the change request;
   * If known, potential methodological issues related to the change (e.g., data unreliability/bias, potential data collection challenges; and
   * Information about whether the data element is being collected elsewhere.

   The PLS Reposity includes templates to creat issues and the [FY 2022 PLS data element definitions](https://github.com/IMLS/public-libraries-survey/blob/master/FY%202022%20Data%20Elements.pdf) saved to the PLS repository. 

3. [Review the  list of issues/proposed changes to the FY 2022 data elements](https://github.com/IMLS/public-libraries-survey/issues); click on individual issues to see their contents, and add comments to further discussion.  The list provides a [training example](https://github.com/IMLS/public-libraries-survey/issues/4) if you would like to see an issue in action. 

If you have questions or need additional guidance, please reach out to the PLS Help Desk (PLS@air.org) or an SDC mentor (Verena Getahun, Joe Hamlin, Amanda Johnson, Kelly Metzger, or Whitney Payne). 


## Deadlines
All proposed changes are due by **COB Wednesday, August 31, 2022**. All comments are due by COB Wednesday, September 7, 2022.


## Next Steps
At the Fall meeting of the Library Statistics Working Group (LSWG) in October, the LSWG will decide which change requests should receive further consideration by a subcommittee, including development into new or revised data elements. From November 2022 through June 2023, AIR and the LSWG subcommittee(s) will develop and pre-test the data elements. SDCs will have an opportunity to discuss the changes under LSWG consideration during the meeting events in December. After development and testing, LSWG will review the final data element changes and approve which will be placed on the ballot and go to states for a vote in August 2023. Following this vote, IMLS will announce the ratified data element changes in October 2023—about 9 months before Group 1 state surveys open in July 2024.
